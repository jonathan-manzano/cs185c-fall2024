# Weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)

In this project, the role of a weakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the formation of the
North Atlantic warming hole will be investigated.
In particular, the following science question will be observed:

*What is the impact of freshwater inflow from increased precipitation on the Nordic Seas (Greenland Sea, Iceland Sea,
and Norwegian Sea)?*

To address this question,
a model of the world map will be constructed,
and two simulations will be run over a year-long period:
a run with precipitation and a run without precipitation.
The experiment will be conducted for the year 2009,
which is prior to the drastic loss in mass of Greenland's ice sheet,
as visualized by [GRACE Tellus](https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/30/greenland-ice-loss-2002-2021/) in 2010 and 2017.
It is hypothesized that cooler temperatures will be shown in the Nordic Seas and Subarctic North Atlantic in the model
with the influx of precipitation,
while the Tropical Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere Oceans will display warmer temperatures.

For the initial conditions,
the state of the ECCO Version 5 Model in January 2009 will be used.
In addition,
external forcing conditions for this model will be constructed from the ECCO Version 5 model output.
To analyze the results, a timeseries of temperature off the East Coast of Florida on the Gulf Stream will be created.
For visualization,
a movie of temperature differences between the models will be generated.
