# SJSU Spring 2025 CS 185C: Advanced Practical Computing Topics

This repository contains the coursework of CS 185C led by [Dr. Mike Wood](https://github.com/mhwood).
Each CS 185C offered at San Jose State University, offers a distinct field of research.

The Coursework follows along with Dr. Wood's online textbook:
