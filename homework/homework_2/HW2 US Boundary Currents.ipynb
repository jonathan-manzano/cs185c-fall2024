    "#### Overview\n",
    "In class, we examined the general structure of ocean circulation on large scales and found that major ocean basins contain gyres - large circulation cells in the ocean. Further, we saw that vertical motion is driven by changes in density. In this homework, you will examine the structure of the ocean currents along the east and west coasts of the U.S and consider how these currents fit into the broader ocean circulation.\n",
