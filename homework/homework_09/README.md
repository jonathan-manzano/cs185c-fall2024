# North Atlantic Warming Hole

In this project, I will investigate the role of a weakening Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the
formation of the North Atlantic warming hole. In particular, I will observe the following science question:

_What is the impact of freshwater inflow from Greenland ice melt on the formation and sustainability of the warming hole
in the North Atlantic?_

I will use the MIT General Circulation Model (MITgcm) to run two simulations over a 15-year period: a control run with
current freshwater input and a freshwater influx run with increased meltwater from Greenland in order to examine the
effects of freshwater inflow from Greenland ice melt on the formation and sustainability of the North Atlantic warming
hole.

The simulations will focus on the North Atlantic region from Greenland southward to 30Â°N, using initial
conditions from the ECCO Version 4 Model for January 1992. Boundary and external forcing will be derived from ECCO
Version 4 Model output. I expect that the freshwater influx run will show a weakened Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC) and more pronounced cooling in the North Atlantic warming hole compared to the control run. To 
analyze the results, I will generate timeseries of sea surface temperature and AMOC strength and create spatial maps
to visualize temperature and salinity changes. Additionally, I will produce an animation illustrating the evolution of the warming hole under increased freshwater conditions.
